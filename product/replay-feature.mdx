title: "Replay Feature"
description: "Replay captures an event timeline behind each screenshot so teams can reproduce flows and give developers richer context. It records a privacy‑aware HTML snapshot of the DOM in the background, stored locally with strict security, and only leaves your machine when you choose to share a replay link."

### What Replay Does

- **Event Timeline**\
  See the exact sequence of user actions (clicks, navigations, inputs) and UI state changes around the incident.
- **DOM HTML Recording (Background)**\
  Lightweight, privacy‑aware HTML snapshots of the DOM captured in the background to reconstruct the page state without live access.
- **One‑Link Playback**\
  Share a single link that plays back the timeline with technical signals (console, network, environment) aligned to each moment.
- **Developer Context**\
  Pair the playback with device/OS, browser/version, viewport, console logs, and network summaries so the fix is clear.

### Privacy & Security

- **Local‑First Storage**\
  The HTML recording, timeline, and technical context are stored on the user’s computer by default and do not leave the device until a replay link is explicitly shared.
- **Data Minimization**\
  The recording prioritizes structure and state (DOM) over sensitive payloads. Credentials, cookies, and request/response bodies are not captured by default.
- **Secure Transport & Access**\
  When shared, replay data is transmitted over encrypted channels and scoped to the recipient workspace with role‑based access.
