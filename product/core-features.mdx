## One‑Click Capture 

Create a screenshot with automatic device/OS, browser/version, viewport, console logs, network summary, and session steps.

More details: [Data Captured](/product/data-captured)

## Dev‑Ready Report 

Each capture becomes a single shareable link that includes repro steps and context - no manual typing.

## Push to Your Stack 

Send the report to [Jira](/integrations/jira) and [Slack](/integrations/slack) with fields pre‑filled and labels applied.

## Collaboration 

Comment directly on the page, @mention teammates, and see real‑time updates on the shared link.

## **AI Assist**

AI reads the page and context, proposes fixes, and updates status. You can ask about recorded videos, generate tasks, and create ready-made templates.

## **Loom‑Style Recording**

Record short videos of issues with tasks auto‑generated based on transcription.
