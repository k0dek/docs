title: "MCP"
description: "Toolbar MCP lets AI agents and developer tools load your bug report context directly from Toolbar: screen recordings, screenshots, console logs, network requests, user actions, and AI summaries. 
Paste a Toolbar link into a supported MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, etc.), and the agent can instantly see what happened instead of asking you to re-explain steps to reproduce."
---

## How to get started?  

You’ll need:

- The Toolbar browser extension installed
- At least one recording or screenshot link

If you don’t have one yet, [install the extension](/product/install-extension) and create a quick test recording.

## **Configure your MCP client** 

### **Claude Code** 

In your terminal, run:

```shellscript
claude mcp add Toolbar
https://mcp.usetool.bar -t http -s user
```

## **How to use it**?

1. Copy a toolbar link or multiple links (recording / screenshot / replay).
2. Open Claude Code and start a new chat.
3. Paste the link into your prompt and describe what you want (debug, create tickets, summarize, etc.).
4. Approve any Toolbar MCP tool calls when Claude asks.

## **Prompt examples**

Debug a bug:

```
Use Toolbar MCP on this recording <Toolbar Link> and:
- explain what went wrong
- show the relevant console logs or network errors
- propose a fix in our codebase
```

Implement design / product feedback:

```
I recorded product feedback in this Toolbar link <Toolbar Link>.
Use Toolbar MCP to extract all requested changes and propose an implementation plan
with concrete steps and files/components to touch.
```

## **FAQ**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need the extension installed?" defaultOpen>
    You only need an existing Toolbar link to use MCP, but the extension is how most people record.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can you use multiple links in one prompt?">
    Yes, but for best results (and context limits), start with one link per analysis.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What access does AI get?">
    Toolbar MCP respects your existing workspace permissions - AI only sees what you can already see in Toolbar.
