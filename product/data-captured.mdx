> URL: **Product Link**\
> Timestamp: **August 30, 2025 at 6:22 PM GMT+3**\

### Debug Signals

**Console Logs**

- **What we store**\
  Selected console entries near the incident (error/warn/info), with timestamps.\
  Example: ERROR at 15:42:12 - TypeError: Cannot read property ‘x’ of undefined
- **Why it matters**\
  Speeds JS debugging by surfacing relevant errors without reproducing first.

**Network Summary**

- **What we store**\
  Lightweight request metadata (URL, method, status, timing). Bodies and headers are not collected by default.\
  Example: GET /api/items → 500 (1200 ms)
- **Why it matters**\
  Helps trace API failures, latency spikes, and resource loading issues.

### User Actions (Steps)

**Session Steps → Repro**

- **What we store**\
  A concise sequence of recent user actions (clicks, navigations, inputs) converted into readable reproduction steps.\
  Example:
  1. Clicked “Add to Cart”
  2. Navigated to “/checkout”
  3. Submit payment form → error banner appears

### Why These Fields Matter

1. **Faster reproduction:** OS, browser, and window size remove guesswork for developers.
2. \*\*Precise traceability: \*\*URL and timestamp align reports with releases and observability signals.
3. **Regional diagnostics:** Country informs CDN routing, localization, and feature flags.
4. **Visual fidelity:** Screenshot size confirms the captured evidence quality.
