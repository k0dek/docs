## Overview

Toolbar is one browser extension for all bug reports. Capture screenshots with automatic technical context, record Loom‑style videos, push bug reports to your task manager, talk with an AI that knows the full context, see user actions, and collaborate with your team in real time.

Join teams who spare themselves unnecessary explanations and stop leaving devs guessing.
